# Challenge to Recreate 512 Paths with Slidify and rCharts
Seeing the amazing work of Ramnath Vaidyanathan inspired me to attempt to recreate one of my favorite visualizations of all time -- [NYT 512 Paths to the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=1&) -- using R with slidify and rCharts.  The exercise has filled in lots of gaps in my knowledge of these two packages, especially how they might integrate.

See the tutorial created entirely from R with [slidify](http://slidify.org) at http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_512paths.
